Sustainable Fuel Blend Property Predictor
A machine learning project from the Shell AI Hackathon for Sustainable and Efficient Energy to predict the properties of complex fuel blends using a CatBoost model and an interactive Streamlit application.

Project Overview
The global push for sustainability is revolutionizing the energy sector. Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAFs) are at the forefront of this change, offering a path to significantly reduce the environmental footprint of the aviation industry. However, creating optimal fuel blends is a highly complex challenge. The relationships between component fractions and final blend properties are non-linear and involve synergistic effects that are difficult to predict.

This project tackles that challenge head-on. The goal was to develop a robust predictive model that can accurately forecast the final properties of a fuel blend based on its constituent components. By doing so, this tool can help accelerate the research and development of new, sustainable fuel formulations, reducing costs and time-to-market.

The Solution
This repository contains two key components:
A Predictive Machine Learning Model: A CatBoost regressor model that has been trained on a dataset of complex fuel blends. It leverages extensive feature engineering to understand the intricate relationships between fuel components.
An Interactive Web Application: A Streamlit dashboard that provides a user-friendly interface to the model. Users can upload data for new blend compositions and receive instant predictions of the final properties.
Key Features
Advanced Feature Engineering: The model's accuracy is built on a foundation of over 150 engineered features designed to capture:
Weighted Blend Properties: Calculating the blend's expected properties based on component fractions.
Component Dominance: Analyzing the influence of the primary base fuel (Component 4).
Chemical Synergy: Modeling the interaction effects between pairs of components.
Blend Complexity: Using metrics like entropy and Gini coefficient to quantify the diversity of the blend.
Accurate Predictions: Utilizes a MultiOutputRegressor with CatBoost, a powerful gradient boosting library optimized for performance and accuracy.
Interactive UI: Allows for easy data upload and visualization of results, making the model accessible to non-technical users.
Feature Importance Analysis: The app visualizes the top 20 features that most influence the model's predictions, providing insights into the key drivers of fuel properties.
Technical Stack
Core Language: Python
Data Science: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn
Machine Learning: CatBoost
Web Framework: Streamlit
Model Persistence: Joblib
How to Run Locally
Follow these steps to set up and run the project on your local machine.

Prerequisites
Python 3.9 or higher
Git
1. Clone the Repository
First, clone this repository to your local machine.

# UPDATE THIS LINK

git clone https://github.com/GauravMaheshh/Fuel-Blend-Prediction-Model.git
cd Fuel-Blend-Prediction-Model

2. Set Up a Virtual Environment (Recommended)
This keeps the project's dependencies isolated.

# Create the virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv

# Activate it
# On macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate
# On Windows:
# venv\Scripts\activate

3. Install Dependencies
Install all the required libraries from the requirements.txt file.

pip install -r requirements.txt

4. Prepare Data and Train the Model
You only need to do this step once.
Download the Data: Place the train.csv file from the hackathon into a new folder named dataset.
Run the Training Script: This will create the catboost_fuel_blend_model.joblib file.
python train_model.py

5. Launch the Streamlit App
Now, you can run the interactive application.

streamlit run app.py

Note: If you get a command not found error, run this command instead:
python3 -m streamlit run app.py

Your web browser will automatically open with the application running. You can now upload the test.csv file to see the model in action!
